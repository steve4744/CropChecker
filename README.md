Crop Checker is a simple utility plugin for Spigot/Minecraft 1.13 and 1.14. Well suited to Survival and Skyblock servers, it will allow players to display the growth status of any of their crops.

Simply by right-clicking the crop with a hoe, it will briefly display on screen the name and age of the crop. The age is shown as a percentage from 0% (growth not started) to 100% (fully grown).

Starting with Spigot/Minecraft 1.14, you can also right-click the Composter to display how full it is.

By default, the information is displayed for 3 seconds on a small Scoreboard on the right-hand side of the screen. If you prefer, the information can be displayed on a BossBar, using the bar to visually display progress. The bar colour, text colour and display time are all configurable in the config.yml file.

With Minecraft/Spigot 1.14, there is also the option to display the text on the ActionBar. The colour of the text can again be set in the config.yml file.
