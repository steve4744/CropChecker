Crop Checker is a simple utility plugin for Spigot/Minecraft 1.13 to 1.15. Well suited to Survival and Skyblock servers, it will allow players to display the growth status of any of their crops, as well as the status of other items, such as the honey level of bee hives.

Simply by right-clicking the crop/item with a hoe, it will briefly display on screen the name and age of the crop. The age is shown as a percentage from 0% (growth not started) to 100% (fully grown). The name of the crop/item displayed can be set or translated to any language in 'strings.yml'.

From Spigot/Minecraft 1.15, you can right-click a beehive or bee-nest to display its honey level.
From Spigot/Minecraft 1.14, you can right-click the Composter to display how full it is.

By default, the information is displayed for 3 seconds on a small Scoreboard on the right-hand side of the screen. If you prefer, the information can be displayed on a BossBar, using the bar to visually display progress. The bar colour, text colour and display time are all configurable in the 'config.yml' file.

Starting with Minecraft/Spigot 1.14, there is also the option to display the text on the ActionBar. The colour of the text can again be set in the config.yml file.
