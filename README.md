Crop Checker is a simple utility plugin for Spigot/Minecraft 1.13 and 1.14. Well suited to Survival and Skyblock servers, it will allow players to display the growth status of any of their crops.

Simply by right-clicking the crop with a hoe, it will briefly display on screen the name and age of the crop. The age is shown as a percentage from 0% (growth not started) to 100% (fully grown).

Starting with Spigot/Minecraft 1.14, you can also right-click the Composter to display how full it is.

This plugin is only supported on Spigot/Minecraft 1.13.2, and 1.14.
